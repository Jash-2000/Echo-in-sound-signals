# Signals and Systems Assignment

This repository contains various signals analysis projects I did in 2020 and 2021. I have also added the finall project in this repository. For these, I followed the book **Signals and Systems**, Book by **Alan V. Oppenheim**

## Final Project

This project generates echo in sound waves using matlab.

You can add your own audio in to the program or also record your own audio. I have also added a feature where you can control the reverb and output amplitude ( just like a DJ's sound controller ) in the code :

This is the function for the project. This will have 4 parameters
  * 1st is the input signal
  * 2nd is the sampling frequency
  * 3rd is the reverb delay length in seconds
  * 4th is the amplitude of echo sound

## Project Files Description

 1. **Development of an 7th order Butterworth filter and plotting the B(s)B(-s) signal**

For my case, the filter is a low pass normalizing filter and hence, the poles would lie on the boundary of the circle r = Wc.

     | B(s) | B(s)B(-s) |
     |------|-----------|

The transfer function obtained is as follows :
