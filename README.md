# Signals and Systems Assignment

## Final Project

This project generates echo in sound waves using matlab.

You can add your own audio in to the program or also record your own audio. I have also added a feature where you can control the reverb and output amplitude ( just like a DJ's sound controller ) in the code :

This is the function for the project. This will have 4 parameters
  * 1st is the input signal
  * 2nd is the sampling frequency
  * 3rd is the reverb delay length in seconds
  * 4th is the amplitude of echo sound
